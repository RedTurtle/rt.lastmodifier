Documentation
=============

Catalog changes
---------------

After installing this product, the catalog of your Plone site will be populated with a new index and a metadata
column: the ``Modifier``.
This will be the last user who performed a content change (both editing review state change).

Other products can start using this index for performing special searches.

Expand the document byline section
----------------------------------

Optionally, this new information can be added to the content's view.

To enable this you need to access ZMI and change the new ``displayLastModifierInByline`` property for the
``site_properties`` property sheet, checking it.

Please, note that this will also works for the new-style byline, that can also display the publication
date (see PLIP `#8699`__):

In facts, this can backport the publication date feature to older Plone versions (but this is a side effect of
the product, not a wanted feature).

When the new byline information is used?
----------------------------------------

* ``displayLastModifierInByline`` must be true.
* *Creator* and *Modifier* must be not equals (just for not show a duplicate link).

Installation
============

Add ``rt.lastmodifier`` to your buildout:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    ...
    
    [instance]
    ...
    eggs=
       ...
       rt.lastmodifier

After that, install the "rt.lastmodifier" add-on product.

.. Note::
    Installation wil trigger the new index creation and population. This can require some times
    on huge sites.
