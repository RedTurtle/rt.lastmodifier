* Renamed the product from "collective.lastmodifier" to "rt.lastmodifier".
  This is unbelievable and embarassing, but I didn't find `collective.lastmodifier`__ when I looked for

  __ https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.lastmodifier

  However the original product is using a different approach.
* Added collection criteria (for new and old ones)
