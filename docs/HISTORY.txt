0.2 (2013-04-17)
----------------

* Renamed the product from "collective.lastmodifier" to "rt.lastmodifier".
  This is unbelievable and embarassing, but I didn't find `collective.lastmodifier`__ when I looked for
  a Plone product with those features... and in the end I choosed the same name!

  However the original product is using a different approach.
* Added collection criteria (for new and old ones)
